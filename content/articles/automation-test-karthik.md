# Autonomous Deployment Test - Created by Yoga AI Agent

This is a test page to verify that **Yoga AI Agent** can autonomously make changes to this website for **Karthik**.

## Purpose

This test confirms that:
- GitHub authentication is working correctly
- Git remote is configured with proper PAT
- Automatic deployment pipeline is functioning
- Changes can be pushed and deployed without manual intervention

## Change Details

- **Created by:** Yoga AI Agent
- **Created for:** Karthik
- **Date:** February 21, 2026
- **File:** `automation-test-karthik.md`
- **Purpose:** Verify autonomous operation

## What This Tests

### 1. GitHub Authentication
✅ Can Yoga push to GitHub repository?
✅ Is PAT token valid and configured?
✅ Are credentials working correctly?

### 2. Deployment Pipeline
✅ Does Vercel detect changes?
✅ Does automatic deployment work?
✅ Do changes appear on live site?

### 3. Autonomy
✅ Can Yoga make changes without Karthik's help?
✅ Can articles be published automatically?
✅ Can code be updated independently?

## Next Steps

If this page appears on the live website at:
- **https://aiheartbeat.vercel.app**

Then autonomous deployment is confirmed working!
